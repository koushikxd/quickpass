# qpass - AI-Powered Password Generator ü§ñ‚ú®

The most over-engineered password generator in existence! Why use boring old `crypto/rand` when you can harness the power of artificial intelligence to create your passwords?

## Why This Exists

Someone once said "you could just do `openssl rand -base64 24`" - and they were absolutely right.

## Features

- üß† **AI-Generated Passwords**: Powered by GPT-4o Mini because why not?
- üí∏ **Costs Money**: Each password generation costs you OpenAI API credits!
- üåê **Requires Internet**: No offline generation for you!
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Network Latency**: Wait for your password like it's 1995!
- üìã **Still Copies to Clipboard**: At least this part still works normally
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-platform**: The absurdity works everywhere
- üìè **Customizable Length**: Tell the AI exactly how many characters you want
- üôà **Hide Option**: Hide your expensive AI-generated password

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need to pay OpenAI for the privilege of generating passwords
2. **Internet Connection**: Because AI lives in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è
3. **Patience**: Network requests take time, unlike instant local generation

### Setup

1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/koushikyemula/qpass
cd qpass
go mod tidy
go build -o qpass
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env.local
```

3. Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account (because passwords aren't free anymore!)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Generate a 10-character AI-powered password (and pay for it):

```bash
qpass
```

Watch as your terminal shows:
```
ü§ñ Consulting our AI overlords for a password...
‚ú® Password successfully generated by artificial intelligence!
Xk9#mP2$nQ
```

### Options

- `-n <length>`: Tell the AI how many characters you want (default: 10)
- `-h`: Hide the expensive password output (still copies to clipboard)

### Examples

```bash
# Generate a 12-character password (costs slightly more)
qpass -n 12

# Generate password without showing it (but still pay for it)
qpass -h

# Combine options for maximum over-engineering
qpass -n 16 -h
```

## Requirements

### Essential Requirements
- **OpenAI Account with Credits**: Because security costs money now
- **Stable Internet**: Your passwords depend on it
- **Patience**: AI thinking takes time

### Clipboard Utilities (Still Normal)
- **macOS**: Uses `pbcopy` (built-in)
- **Linux**: Requires `xclip` or `xsel`
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install xclip
  # or
  sudo apt-get install xsel
  ```
- **Windows**: Uses `clip` (built-in)

## Character Set

The AI decides what characters to use! We've trained it to include:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Uppercase letters: `A-Z`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Special characters: `!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?/`

But really, it's up to the AI overlords now. ü§ñ

## Security

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This is a joke project! Don't actually use this for real passwords!
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini to generate passwords (because why not?)
- Network requests mean your password generation isn't air-gapped
- Costs real money for fake security
- The AI might hallucinate your password (but it probably won't)
- No password storage or logging (we can't afford the API costs)
- Each password costs you approximately $0.00001 in API credits

## Why You Shouldn't Use This

1. **Cost**: Each password costs money
2. **Latency**: Network requests are slow
3. **Dependency**: Requires internet and OpenAI to be up
4. **Overkill**: `openssl rand -base64 24` is literally right there
5. **Irony**: Using AI for something that should be deterministically random

## The Better Alternative

Just use this instead:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 24
```

But where's the fun in that? üòÑ
